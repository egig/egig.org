[Why
laravel](http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1eld2t/why_would_anyone_choose_laravel_over_symfony_or/)
?  
There is Taylor Otwel, Author of Laravel, commented at that post.
Personally, one of the reason that I used to pick a framework is
"taste", and I admit it, laravel has nice taste,  
Laravel has nice sintax. However, "Tak Kenal Maka Tak Sayang", that
means if you don't really know, then  
you don't really love. Started about two weeks ago, I dig into Laravel.
And Now, what I've got ?

Similiar system like Silex
--------------------------

If you familiar with Silex, then you've got half way to understand
Laravel. The system is quite similiar to Silex.  
Laravel main interface is `Illuminate\Foundation\Application` extends
`Illuminate\Container` component that implements `ArrayAccess`, as well
as  
`Silex\Application` that extends `Pimple`. The Biggest differ is the
Service Provider and Facade. I don't try it yet, but  
probably I will, I guess `Illuminate\Support\Facade` can be implemented
to Silex.

this lines:

    Route::get('/', function()
    {
        return View::make('hello');
    });

can be written as

    $app['router']->get('/', function() use ($app)
    {
        return $app['view']->make('hello');
    });

Facade ?
--------

When you call a class in Laravel, e.g `Route::get()` or `DB::Schema()`,
you actually call a facade extension class.  
The facade class then make use of magic method `__callStatic()` to run
desired function on 'real' class.  
'Real' class is a class that registered to be bound to Laravel
Application. Each class registered via it's Service Provider listed at
the  
app config file (`app/config/app.php`) as array : 'providers'. To get to
know what is the 'Real' Class that  
you are calling, you can use

    Facade::getFacadeRoot();

e.g,

    $realClass  = View::getFacadeRoot();
    return get_class($realClass); // will print Illuminate\View\Environment

    //or

    $realClass  = Route::getFacadeRoot();
    return get_class($realClass); // will print Illuminate\Routing\Router

Have a look into
`vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Route/RoutingServiceProvider`,
that one of listed provider at app config file, it contains such this
line:

    ...

    $this->app['router'] = $this->app->share(function($app)
    {
        $router = new Router($app); //<<-- has namespace Illuminate\Routing
    ...

and also
`vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/View/ViewServiceProvider`

    ...

    $this->app['view'] = $this->app->share(function($app)
    {
        $resolver = $app['view.engine.resolver'];

        $finder = $app['view.finder'];

        $env = new Environment($resolver, $finder, $app['events']); //<<-- has namespace Illuminate/View

        return $env
    ...

And take a look into array 'aliases' at `app/config/app.php`. Notice
that `View` is (or alias of) Facade for `$app['view']` that instantiate
`Illuminate\View\Environment`,  
as well ass `Route` is (or alias of) Facade for `$app['router']` that
instantiate `Illuminate\Routing\Router`;

Artisan, where are those commands registered ?
----------------------------------------------

Artisan use Symfony Console component that you have to do
`$console->add(new YourOwnCommand);` to register  
your own Command. While running `php artisan list` then you get some
list and description for each command that  
available in artisan, e.g migrate:make, dump-autoload, etc, You may
wonder, where are those commands  
registered ? I also have some question at the time and then start to
think of a list of `add` calls or such an iteration.  
However, there is no such massal regitration for those command. Take a
look into  
`vendor/laravel/framework/src/illuminate/Support/ServiceProvider.php`,
you'll find

    public function commands($commands)

In fact, each artisan command is registered via above `commands` method
when related ServiceProvider run `register()` method. Just for sure,
take a look at
`vendor/laravel/framework/src/illuminate/Database/MigrationServiceProvider.php`
contains

    protected function registerCommands()
    {
        $commands = array('Migrate', 'Rollback', 'Reset', 'Refresh', 'Install', 'Make');

        $this->commands(
        'command.migrate', 'command.migrate.make',
        'command.migrate.install', 'command.migrate.rollback',
        'command.migrate.reset', 'command.migrate.refresh'
    );

See ? it seems like we always need Laravel Application to use Artisan.

Conclusion
----------

Beside it's Artisan, Eloquent ORM and Blade Template System, Laravel is
Silex with it's own Service Provider Class. And Facade is a sugar that
make 'em all tasted better.
